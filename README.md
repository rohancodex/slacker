# slacker
### For the times you have to "slack" off work
#### This script will move your mouse after every one minute keeping you online on slack. You can customize the duration by making changes to the file of course.
 You can straight up run the exe if you are on windows. (You might want to turn off your windows defender as it identifies the script as a trojan for some reason).
### Best alternative still is to just clone the repo and run the script locally.
